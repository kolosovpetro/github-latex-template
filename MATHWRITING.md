PLAIN TEXT CHECKLIST: GENERAL WRITING RULES FOR INTEGERS

Use this as a final checklist before submission.

1. Page layout
   - All text, formulas, tables, and figures must stay inside the page margins.
   - No equation or figure may extend into the margin.

2. Sentence beginnings
   - Every sentence must start with a normal English word.
   - Do NOT start a sentence with a formula or symbol.
   - Bad:  n^2 is an integer.
   - Good: For all integers n, the quantity n^2 is an integer.
   - This rule also applies to theorem statements.

3. Text before theorems and similar environments
   - The sentence immediately before a theorem, lemma, definition, remark, etc. must:
     - Be a complete sentence
     - End with a period
   - Good: We now state the following result.
   - Bad: We now state the following result:

4. Section and subsection titles
   - Capitalize the first letter of each important word.
   - Do not capitalize articles, conjunctions, or prepositions.
   - Example:
     - Good: Sums of Powers via Finite Differences
     - Bad: Sums Of Powers Via Finite Differences

5. Contractions
   - Do not use contractions.
   - Bad: don’t, can’t, it’s, we’ve
   - Good: do not, cannot, it is, we have

6. Definitions
   - When defining a term, write the defined word or phrase in italics.
   - Do not use boldface.
   - Example:
     - We define the sequence a_n to be the central difference sequence.

7. Tables and figures
   - Every table and figure must have:
     - A number (label)
     - A caption
   - The caption must appear below the table or figure, not above it.

8. Referring to theorems and similar results
   - Capitalize the word when it has a number.
   - Do not abbreviate.
   - Good: Theorem 3, Lemma 2, Corollary 5
   - Bad: theorem 3, Thm. 3

9. Referring to equations
   - Always write: Equation (n)
   - Do not write: Eq. (n) or (n) alone.

10. Logical symbols in text
    - Do not use symbols in running text.
    - Do not use: &, ∃, ∀
    - Use words instead:
      - and
      - there exists
      - for all

11. Logical arrows
    - Prefer words instead of arrows or double arrows.
    - Write:
      - if and only if
      - implies
    - Avoid: ⇒, ⇔ in normal text.

12. Commas in lists (Oxford comma)
    - When listing three or more items, include a comma before "and".
    - Example:
      - Good: a, b, and c
      - Bad: a, b and c
    - This rule also applies to bibliographies with three or more authors.

13. Referencing figures, tables, and equations
    - Every numbered figure, table, and equation must be mentioned in the text.
    - Do not number an equation unless you refer to it in the paper.

14. References
    - Every item in the bibliography must be cited somewhere in the text.
    - No unused references are allowed.

15. Mathematical expressions inside sentences
    - Avoid placing two formulas separated only by a comma.
    - Bad: Let f(n), g(n) be functions.
    - Good: Let f(n) and g(n) be functions.

16. Commas after transition words
    - If a sentence starts with words like:
      - Thus
      - Therefore
      - Hence
    - Always put a comma after that word.
    - Example:
      - Thus, we obtain the desired identity.

17. Paragraph indentation
    - Only the first line of a new paragraph should be indented.
    - Do not indent lines for any other reason.

18. Single-paragraph rule
    - Each of the following must be exactly one paragraph:
      - Theorem statements
      - Lemma statements
      - Definitions
      - Remarks
      - Examples
      - Acknowledgements section

19. Punctuation after displayed equations
    - If a sentence ends with a displayed equation, add a period.
    - The period goes at the end of the last line of the display.

20. Long equations
    - If a mathematical expression is long and spans multiple lines of text,
      put it in display mode instead of inline math.

21. Bold text
    - Do not use boldface text in the body of the paper.
    - Bold is allowed only for:
      - Section titles
      - Subsection titles
      - Theorem, lemma, definition, remark, and example headings
